After completing my MSc in Drug Discovery and Pharma Management and working in the field for a while, I realised that I wasn't passionate about this subject. It wasn't until I started coding that I understood what being passionate about something really means. Now after 16 weeks of studying at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/become/makers-academy), I can't wait to keep learning and challenging myself.

## <a name="skills">**SKILLS**</a>
  
* **Client management**

  In a previous role I occasionally had to handle clients who felt they had not received a satisfactory service. I was able to deal with problems swiftly and directly, usually over the phone with very little notice, and ensure that clients maintained their confidence in us for future transactions. Such problems often arose when personnel did not show up for roles, and it was my duty to find adequate replacement within a very tight timeframe.


* **Personnel management**

  In my role as an operational administrator, I was tasked to ensure all personnel were assigned to roles which suited their availability and capabilities while dealing with the demands of clients.


* **Project coordination**

  In the same role mentioned above, my principle task was to coordinate between approximately 1000 employees and more than 50 clients. Calls from clients demanding staff had to be answered immediately, then a suitable candidate found and assigned in short order. Assignments already underway needed to be monitored simultaneously, and any problems likewise handled at once. My strong organisational and time management skills allowed me to get all those tasks done.


* **Additional skills:**
  * Foreign Languages: French, Arabic
