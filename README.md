* **Client management**



* **Personnel management**

  My role at Hirehand was to assign hands to shifts based on their skills, rating, location and availability. I had to make sure that all hands were satisfied with the number and quality of their shifts and also make sure they arrive on time to their shifts and dress appropriately.


* **Project coordination**

  While I was working at Hirehand, I was responsible of live operations. This involved answering all messages immediately, assigning hands to shifts, answering calls from clients, making sure that hands are at their shifts on time. All this has to be done simultaneously. I was able to do that by coordinating my tasks and managing my time.
